Migrating to PyTorch 0.4.0
==========================

The training session at O'Reilly AI in NYC, 2018 will be conducted using PyTorch 0.3.1. However, as of the end of April, PyTorch 0.4.0 has been released!

To help you understand how to migrate, the PyTorch folks have a wonderful migration guide found `here <http://pytorch.org/2018/04/22/0_4_0-migration-guide.html>`_.
